CAREFULLY FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. Lets think step by step.

Task description:
In this task, you will evaluate one metric of an image generated by AI: **Text-Alignment** (how well the image matches the prompt).
To correctly make the evaluation, follow the instructions carefully.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Understand the Textual Prompt
    a. Extract the core meaning of the prompt.
    b. Identify key elements such as objects, actions, relationships, emotions, colors, styles, or any specific details mentioned.
    
    Example:
    - Prompt: "A realistic painting of a golden retriever playing with a red ball in a sunny park."
    - Core elements: realistic painting, golden retriever, playing, red ball, sunny park.

2. Analyze the Image
    a. Identify the main subjects, objects, actions, and visual characteristics.
    b. Consider composition, colors, textures, lighting, and overall fidelity to the prompt.

    Example:
    - Does the dog breed match a golden retriever?
    - Is the ball red?
    - Is the park bright and sunny?
    - Is the painting style realistic or abstract?

3. Rate the image using the Text-Alignment metric (0 = worst, 1 = best)

**Evaluation Criteria for Text Alignment**
1. Check if the main objects and actions in the prompt appear in the image.
2. Assess semantic alignment:
    - If the prompt says ‚Äúa red apple,‚Äù and the image has a green apple ‚Äî this is a mismatch.
3. Consider stylistic and contextual alignment:
    - If the prompt says ‚Äúa sketch of a city skyline at night,‚Äù but the image is a photorealistic rendering, the style is not aligned.

**Examples of Alignment Ratings**:

- **1.0** ‚Üí *Perfect match*:  
  Prompt: "A watercolor painting of a white cat sleeping on a windowsill during winter."  
  Image: A delicate watercolor showing a white cat curled up on a snowy windowsill.

- **0.8 - 0.9** ‚Üí *High alignment*:  
  Prompt: "A pirate ship in a thunderstorm, viewed from above."  
  Image: A ship with pirate flags in stormy waters, but viewed from the side rather than above.

- **0.5 - 0.7** ‚Üí *Partial match*:  
  Prompt: "A dragon flying over a medieval village at sunset."  
  Image: A dragon is present, but the background is a modern city at night.

- **0.2 - 0.4** ‚Üí *Low alignment*:  
  Prompt: "A child blowing bubbles in a summer field."  
  Image: A child is sitting in a park, but there are no bubbles or summery elements.

## Task Overview
In this task, you will comprehensively evaluate how well an image aligns with its corresponding text prompt. You will analyze this alignment from multiple expert perspectives, following a structured methodology to arrive at a final alignment score.

## Process
You will adopt three distinct expert perspectives sequentially. Each expert will analyze ONLY different aspects of alignment and provide scores with detailed rationales. Begin with Expert 1, then Expert 2,Expert 3, and conclude with Expert 5's synthesis.
Expert 1 is Entity detection specialist, Expert 2 is Spatial Relation Specialist, Expert 3 is Activity verification Specialist
## Expert 1: Entity Detection Specialist
üö® IMPORTANT: You are evaluating ONLY entity presence, NOT activities or spatial relationships. 
If the image includes extra entities not mentioned in the prompt (e.g., three cats when the prompt specifies two), it is a misalignment.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU ARE EVALUATING ONLY ENTITIES NOT ACTIVITIES
1. Carefully analyze the text prompt and extract ALL entities, categorizing them as follows: EXTRACT ONLY ENTITIES NOT ACTIVITIES
   - Primary entities: Main subjects
   - Secondary entities: Supporting elements that add context
   - Attributes: Specific qualities described (colors, textures, etc.)

2. For each entity and attribute, evaluate representation quality in the image using this scale:
   - Excellent (1.0): Entity appears exactly as described
   - Good (0.8): Entity appears with minor deviations
   - Partial (0.5): Entity is present but significantly different
   - Poor (0.2): Entity is barely recognizable or ambiguous
   - Missing (0.0): Entity is completely absent


EXAMPLE:
> Prompt: "A white wolf standing on a snowy mountain peak, gazing at the full moon"
> 
> Primary entities:
> - Wolf (1.0) - Clearly visible as the main subject
> - Mountain peak (0.8) - Present but less prominent than expected
> - Moon (1.0) - Clearly visible in the background
>
> Secondary entities:
> - Snow (1.0) - Covers the mountain appropriately
>
> Attributes:
> - White (wolf) (0.7) - Wolf is more grey than white
> - Full (moon) (0.8) - Moon appears round but not quite full
>

> ENTITY DETECTION SCORE: 0.8 - High alignment with nearly all entities represented well. The mountain peak is slightly less prominent than expected, and the moon isn't quite full.

Return your score and your thoughts and comments
## Expert 2: Activity Relations Analyst
YOUR ROLE: Composition expert focusing on relationships, positioning, and interactions between elements.

### Instructions
1. Extract all spatial and interactive relationships between entities in the prompt.
   - Positional relationships (above, below, inside, next to)
   - Directional relationships (facing, moving toward)
   - Interactive relationships (touching, holding, using)
   - Scale relationships (larger than, smaller than)

2. Evaluate how accurately each relationship is represented using this scale:
   - Perfect (1.0): Relationship depicted exactly as described
   - Accurate (0.8): Relationship present with minor inaccuracies
   - Partial (0.5): Relationship present but significantly altered
   - Minimal (0.2): Relationship barely perceptible or highly distorted
   - Absent (0.0): Relationship completely missing

3. Assess perspective, depth, and scale consistency across the image.

EXAMPLE:
> Prompt: "A white wolf standing on a snowy mountain peak, gazing at the full moon"
>
> Spatial relationships:
> - Wolf ON mountain peak (0.9) - Wolf is clearly positioned on what appears to be a mountain peak
> - Wolf GAZING AT moon (1.0) - Wolf's head and eyes are directed toward the moon
>
> Perspective analysis:
> - The perspective shows the wolf from a side angle, allowing clear visibility of both the wolf and the moon (1.0)
> - Scale appears natural between elements (0.9) - The wolf and mountain proportions are appropriate
>
> SPATIAL RELATIONS SCORE: 0.95 - The spatial relationships defined in the prompt are represented with high accuracy.


## Expert 3: Activity Verification Specialist
YOUR ROLE: Behavioral analyst ensuring all described actions, activities, and dynamic elements are accurately depicted.

### Instructions
1. Identify all activities, actions, and dynamic states mentioned in the prompt:
   - Explicit actions (running, eating, building)
   - States that imply motion or action (dancing waves, flowing river)
   - Emotional expressions (smiling, crying, laughing)

2. Evaluate how accurately each activity is represented using this scale:
   - Perfect (1.0): Activity depicted exactly as described, with appropriate posture and context
   - Accurate (0.8): Activity recognizable with minor deviations in execution
   - Partial (0.5): Activity suggested but not clearly or convincingly portrayed
   - Minimal (0.2): Activity barely implied or highly ambiguous
   - Absent (0.0): Activity completely missing

3. Consider the naturalness and believability of the activities.

EXAMPLE:
> Prompt: "A white wolf standing on a snowy mountain peak, gazing at the full moon"
>
> Activities:
> - STANDING (0.9) - Wolf is clearly on all fours in a standing position on the peak, though slightly hunched rather than fully erect
> - GAZING (1.0) - Wolf's head position, eye direction, and overall posture convincingly convey the act of gazing at the moon
>
> Action naturalness:
> - The wolf's stance appears natural and anatomically correct (1.0)
> - The gazing behavior is portrayed with appropriate wolf body language (0.9)
>
> ACTIVITY VERIFICATION SCORE: 0.95 - The activities described in the prompt are portrayed with high fidelity and natural execution.

## Expert 4: Holistic Alignment Evaluator
YOUR ROLE: Senior evaluator synthesizing previous analyses into a comprehensive alignment assessment.

### Instructions
1. Review and analyze the rationales provided by Experts 1, 2, and 3.

2. Consider additional factors:
   - Artistic/stylistic alignment with implied prompt tone
   - Contextual appropriateness
   - Semantic coherence
   - Overall visual impact

3. Calculate the final alignment score using this weighted formula:
   - Final Score = (0.3 √ó Entity Score) + (0.3 √ó Spatial Score) + (0.3 √ó Activity Score) + (0.1 √ó Contextual Factors)

4. Provide your score with a detailed rationale explaining strengths and weaknesses in alignment.


EXAMPLE:
> FINAL ALIGNMENT EVALUATION
>
> Entity Score: 0.9
> Spatial Relations Score: 0.95
> Activity Verification Score: 0.95
> Contextual Factors Score: 0.85 - The image captures the implied mood of wilderness and solitude, though lighting could better emphasize the moonlight.
>
> Weighted Calculation:
> (0.3 √ó 0.9) + (0.3 √ó 0.95) + (0.3 √ó 0.95) + (0.1 √ó 0.85) = 0.925
>
> FINAL ALIGNMENT SCORE: 0.93 (High Alignment)
>
> Rationale: The image successfully represents all key entities, spatial relationships, and activities from the prompt. The wolf, mountain, and moon are clearly depicted with the correct positioning and orientation. The activities of standing and gazing are convincingly portrayed with natural body language. Minor deviations include the mountain peak being slightly less prominent than might be expected and the moon not appearing completely full. The overall mood and context align well with the prompt's implications.
>
> To achieve perfect alignment: The mountain peak could be more dramatic, the moon could be more clearly full, and the lighting could better emphasize moonlight on the snow.

## Task Overview
In this task, you will comprehensively evaluate how well an image aligns with its corresponding text prompt.
You will analyze this alignment from multiple expert perspectives, following a structured methodology to arrive 5 different scores.
# Process
You will adopt three distinct expert perspectives sequentially. Each expert will analyze ONLY different aspects of alignment and provide scores with detailed rationales. Begins with Expert 1, then Expert 2 -> Expert 3 -> Expert 4 -> Expert 5
## Expert 1: Object presence expert
YOUR ROLE: Understant whether all mentioned objects in prompts are present on image.
**DEFINITION OF OBJECTS**
An object refers to any physical, tangible entity explicitly mentioned in the text prompt that can be visually identified in an image. 
Objects are not activities, actions, or attributes but are instead concrete things that can be classified as either.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

## Expert 2: Attribute Consistency expert
YOUR ROLE: Assess whether the objects in the image have the correct colors, shapes, sizes, textures, and other attributes as described in the text.
**DEFINITION OF SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS**
An attribute refers to any descriptive quality explicitly mentioned in the text prompt that characterizes an object. Attributes describe how an object looks, feels, or behaves, rather than what it is. They are extracted from the prompt and used to assess whether the object in the image aligns with the description.
Types of Attributes

    Color ‚Äì The object's hue or shade (e.g., "red dress," "black cat").

    Shape ‚Äì The object's form or structure (e.g., "round table," "triangular sign").

    Size ‚Äì The object's relative dimensions (e.g., "tiny house," "large elephant").

    Texture ‚Äì The object's surface feel (e.g., "rough rock," "smooth fabric").

    Material ‚Äì What the object is made of (e.g., "wooden table," "metal pole").

    Other Descriptive Qualities ‚Äì Additional properties that define the object's state (e.g., "steaming coffee," "glowing light").

What is NOT an Attribute?

    Objects Themselves (e.g., "car," "tree")

    Actions or Activities (e.g., "jumping," "running")

    Abstract Concepts (e.g., "happiness," "mystery")

    Spatial Relations(e.g man on the left, man on the bike)

ATTRIBUTE CONSISTENCY SCORE: 0.55 ‚Äì Partial consistency due to shape and steam discrepancies.
Expert 4: Activity Verification Expert

YOUR ROLE: Assess if the objects in the image are performing the correct activities as described in the text prompt.
**DEFINITION OF ACTIVITY**
An activity refers to an action or behavior performed by an object (entity) in an image as described in a text prompt. Activities describe what an entity is doing rather than what it is or how it looks.

    Action Verbs ‚Äì Indicate explicit activities (e.g., walking, sitting, eating, running, jumping, holding, carrying).

    Contextual Details ‚Äì Provide additional information about how the activity is performed (e.g., "A man sitting on a bench," "A dog playing with a ball").

What is NOT an Activity?

    Objects Themselves (e.g., "man," "dog")

    Attributes of Objects (e.g., "red dress," "round table")

    Spatial Relationships (e.g., "next to," "behind")
**INSTRUCTIONS**
    1. Extract Activities from the Text Prompt:

        - Identify activities or actions described in the prompt.
        - Activities refer to verbs or actions performed by the primary or secondary entities. Examples: sitting, holding, walking, eating, jumping, running, carrying, playing, etc.
        - Extract any details about how the activity is being performed, if mentioned (e.g., "The man is sitting on the chair," "The dog is playing with a ball").

    2. Analyze the Image and Evaluate Activity Performance:
        - Examine whether the objects (entities) in the image are performing the correct activities as described in the prompt.
        - Use the following rating scale to assess the alignment of the activities:
            - Excellent (1.0): Objects are performing the exact activities as described.
            - Good (0.8): Objects are performing the activity with minor deviations or contextually close actions.
            - Partial (0.5): Objects are involved in the activity, but the action is significantly different or unclear.
            - Poor (0.2): Objects are performing an ambiguous or wrong activity.
            - Missing (0.0): Objects are not performing any activity or the wrong activity entirely.
            - None: No actvities in textual prompt are mentioned, therefore score can not be assigned



EXAMPLES:
Example 1

    Prompt: "A dog playing with a ball in the yard."

    IMAGE: [A dog running with a ball in its mouth in a yard.]

    ACTIVITY VERIFICATION SCORE: None - Score can not be assigned, no activities detected.

## Expert 4: Numerical Consistency Expert

YOUR ROLE: Assess whether the number of objects, entities, or specific numerical quantities described in the text prompt match what is depicted in the image.

**DEFINITION OF NUMERICAL CHARACTERISTICS**
Numerical characteristics refer to any explicit mention of a quantity, count, or number in the text prompt that specifies how many instances of an object or entity should appear in the image. These include:

- Specific counts (e.g., "three dogs," "two children")
- Quantifiers (e.g., "several birds," "a couple of cars," "a dozen flowers")
- Implicit quantities if numerically descriptive words are used (e.g., "pair," "few," "many," "single," "double").

What is NOT a Numerical Characteristic?

- Sizes (e.g., "large house," "tiny cat") ‚Äî evaluated under Attribute Consistency.
- Positional references (e.g., "next to," "behind") ‚Äî evaluated under Spatial Relationships.
- Non-explicit numbers (e.g., "a group of people" without a defined quantity).

**INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Extract Numerical Descriptions from the Text Prompt:
   - Identify all specific numerical mentions regarding quantity of objects or entities.
   - Include both explicit numbers ("four dogs") and implicit counts ("a pair of shoes" means 2 shoes).

2. Carefully analyze the image and count the corresponding objects or entities.

3. Compare the described numbers from the prompt to what is actually shown in the image.

4. Evaluate using the following scale:
    - Excellent (1.0): The number of entities exactly matches the description.
    - Good (0.8): Very minor deviation (¬±1 if reasonable in context, e.g., "several birds" showing 5 instead of 6).
    - Partial (0.5): Noticeable deviation but not extreme (e.g., half the expected number).
    - Poor (0.2): Major mismatch in quantity (e.g., 1 entity when 5 were described).
    - Missing (0.0): Described quantity completely missing or grossly misrepresented.
    - None: No explicit or implicit numbers mentioned in textual prompt, therefore score cannot be assigned.

5. Return your score along with detailed thoughts and comments.

**EXAMPLES:**

Example 1:
Prompt: "Three cats sitting on a sofa."
IMAGE: [Two cats sitting on a sofa.]

Extracted Numerical Description:
- Cats (Three) ‚Üí (0.8) Good (Only 2 cats visible; minor deviation)

NUMERICAL CONSISTENCY SCORE: 0.8 ‚Äì Small mismatch but close to intended number.

Example 2:
Prompt: "A dozen roses in a vase."
IMAGE: [Five roses in a vase.]

Extracted Numerical Description:
- Roses (Twelve) ‚Üí (0.2) Poor (Only five roses present; major deviation)

NUMERICAL CONSISTENCY SCORE: 0.2 ‚Äì Large inconsistency between described and observed quantities.

Example 3:
Prompt: "A single red apple on the table."
IMAGE: [Three red apples on the table.]

Extracted Numerical Description:
- Apple (One) ‚Üí (0.5) Partial (Multiple apples instead of a single one)

NUMERICAL CONSISTENCY SCORE: 0.5 ‚Äì Partial alignment with significant deviation.

## Expert 5: Spatial Relationships Expert
YOUR ROLE: Assess if objects in the image are positioned according to the correct spatial relationships described in the text.
**DEFINITION OF SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS**
A spatial relationship refers to the relative positioning and orientation of objects in an image as described in a text prompt. These relationships define where objects are placed in relation to one another and can include:

    Positioning Terms ‚Äì Describe how objects are situated relative to each other (e.g., next to, above, below, behind, in front of, on top of, inside, outside, between).

    Directional Indicators ‚Äì Specify the direction of an object within the frame (e.g., left, right, center, top, bottom).

    Distance Indicators ‚Äì Indicate how far objects are from each other (e.g., close to, far from, near).

What is NOT a Spatial Relationship?

    Objects Themselves (e.g., "dog," "tree")

    Attributes of Objects (e.g., "red car," "wooden table")

    Actions or Activities (e.g., "running," "sitting")
**INSTRUCTIONS**

    1. Extract Spatial Relationships from the Text Prompt:
        Identify spatial relationships described in the prompt, such as:
            - Positioning terms: next to, above, below, behind, in front of, beside, near, on top of, inside, outside, between and more.
            - Directional indicators: left, right, center, top, bottom.
        Ensure to account for both relative positions (e.g., "next to" or "on top of") and distance (e.g., "close," "far away").
    2. Carefully analyze image and evaluate using following scale:
        Compare the positioning of the objects in the image based on the spatial relationships extracted from the prompt.

        Use the following rating scale to assess the alignment of spatial relationships:
            - Excellent (1.0): Objects are positioned exactly as described in the prompt.
            - Good (0.8): Objects are positioned with minor deviations, but still close to the intended spatial relationship.
            - Partial (0.5): Objects are positioned, but the relationship is significantly different from the description.
            - Poor (0.2): The spatial relationship is barely recognizable or ambiguous.
            - Missing (0.0): Objects are completely out of place, or the relationship is not represented at all.
            - None: No spatial relationships in textual prompt are mentioned, therefore score can not be assigned


EXAMPLES:
